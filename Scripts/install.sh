Install Apple's command line tools first, then re-run this script:

    xcode-select --install

That is a ~1.5 GB download and takes a few minutes.

Installed: $DEST

Grant Accessibility to strafe in the pane that just opened, then:

  1. Delete any older/stale "strafe" rows in that list first. This build is
     ad-hoc signed, so its identity changes on every rebuild and macOS may show
     a previous build as a separate entry.
  2. Quit strafe from its menu-bar icon and launch it again. The event tap is
     created at launch, so the grant does nothing until strafe restarts.
  3. Three-finger swipe between Spaces. It should be instant.
